3 first-fit

My memory arrangement is static, i.e. It has three fix segments. (a) Two integer variable (to store maximum no. of block, say 'n', and no. of free block) (b) interger array of size n (to keep  track of allocation size as well as status (occupied or free)) (c) 8-Byte data block array of size n. Where Each element of size has one to one mapping with data block. Using above two variables and static nature I calculated data of my_heapinfo().Since my Header (SIZE array) doesn't change in size with time (only overwritten) hence there is no such thing as free-list in my code, so if readings of my_heapinfo() doesn't meet your expectation, please mail(vivek9771268610@gmail.com) or call(9587034688) me so that I can explain. I have added a special function "memory_visualizer()" to visualize whole 4KB memory Byte by Byte in proper format. You may or may not use it.
